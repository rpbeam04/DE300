### Homework 1

This homework was done in a Jupyter notebook file that is in this director. To run the code, simply 
place the compressed data file in the same directory as the notebook and run the notebook. The homework
has 5 tasks which are done in order.

I am a bit of an aviation geek (as can be seen in some of my other repos), so I tried to add in some of my own thoughts and interests into the cleaning
process. I very much enjoyed working with this dataset.
